# 🏗 AI Construction Planning Agent

An AI-powered Construction Decision Support System that assists project managers in planning, scheduling, risk evaluation and execution of infrastructure projects using both deterministic planning logic and generative AI.

---

## 📌 Overview

This system combines:

- Generative AI (LLM-based planning)
- Deterministic scheduling logic
- Resource constraint validation
- Risk analysis
- Workforce productivity modelling
- Monte Carlo delay simulation
- External weather risk API

to produce actionable execution plans for construction projects.
